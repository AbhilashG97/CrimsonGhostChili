# Lesson 2

This is the second lesson that was taught in ```Audi-1's``` sqli tutorial. 

## Other ways to break a query

In the first lesson of sqli labs, we were able to break the query by adding a ```'``` at the end of the query. There are other ways to break the query as well. 

In lesson-3 and lesson-4 of the sqli labs test bed, we can break the query by passing ```"```. In these lessons, when we examine the error carefully we get to know that adding a comment at the end of the statement won't solve the error. This because we are dealing with an unbalanced parenthesis. This can be solved by adding the messing parenthesis to the url and then following it up with a comment. 

Both lesson-3 and lesson-4 can be solved this way. 

Lesson 2 also has something similar. On appending ```1\``` to the query. We get ```'\ LIMIT 0,1'``` as the output. Ignoring the ```'``` at the beginning and at the end of the error statment, we can conclude that the user query is not wrapped with a ```'``` or anything else. 

This can be exploited directly. More on this in the later section.
