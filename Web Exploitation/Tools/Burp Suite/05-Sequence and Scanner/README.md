# Sequencer and Scanner

## Sequencer 

The ```sequencer``` is a tool that allows a user to test the randomness of a target (such as a cookie, session-id etc). The sequencer runs a bunch of mathematical tests and gives a detailed report on the randomness of the target. 

If the value of the target is not random, then it can be exploited by understanding the pattern of the target. 

The response of a ```HTTP``` request can be sent to the sequencer where the user can select the target for which the sequencer should perform tests. 

To analyse the session-id of a response from a request, the following can be done - 

1.  Select the request that you want to test from the proxy tab.
1.  Right-click on that request and then send it to the sequencer.
1.  The target can be selected from the ```Token Location within response``` section.
1.  Click on the ```Start Live Capture``` button.
1.  Analyse the results

:warning: The sequencer can be allowed to run till 1000 tokens or more for optimal results.   

## Scanner

The scanner is tool that lists out all the vulnerabilities of a web app. This feature is not part of the community edition and needs to be purchased. 

This tool is really handy for pentesting. 

:star2: More on this tool later.
