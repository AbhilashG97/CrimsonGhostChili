# Repeater Module

This module allows you to execute a request multiple times. This can be used for XSS attacks.

The request can be intercepted from the proxy module and then it can be sent to the repeater module by right-clicking on the desired request.

Also, the repeater has the option to execute a request on the browser if needed. This can be used to get visual confirmation for XSS attacks.
