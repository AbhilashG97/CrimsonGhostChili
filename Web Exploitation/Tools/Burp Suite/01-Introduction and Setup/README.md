# Introduction and Setup

> Burp or Burp Suite is a graphical tool for testing Web application security. The tool is written in Java and developed by PortSwigger Web Security. 

```Burp``` can be used for any application(such as desktop app, web app) that uses ```HTTP``` or ```SSL```.

```Burp``` acts like a proxy between the browser and the server. In order to use ```Burp```, the browser has to be configured to allow all traffic through ```Burp```. 

```Burp``` can then intercept the traffic and perform various actions on the requests and responses. ```Burp``` is made up of several modules that allow the user to perform different actions. Some of the modules are - 

1.  Target
1.  Proxy
1.  Intruder
1.  Repeater
1.  Sequencer
1.  Decoder
1.  Comparer

etc. 

Each of the modules will be discussed in the next section of this repository.
