# Intruder and Comparer

The ```intruder``` and the ```comparer``` are often used together for fuzzing the target app and then analysing the results.

## Intruder

This tool can be used fuzz the target url. The target url can be selected from the proxy tab and it can then be sent to the intruder. 

Once the target url is sent to the intruder, the following can be done with it - 

1.  The type of attack can be selected from the ```Positions``` sub-tab.  
1.  The portion of the ```HTTP``` request that needs to be fuzzed is also added. By default, ```Burp``` loads a few fields which it thinks can be fuzzed. 
1.  Now, the payload needs to be set. This can be done by going to the ```Payloads``` tab. 
    1.  The type of payload needs to be set. The default is set to ```Simple list```. 
    1.  In the ```Payload Options``` section, we can enter the payload that will be used to fuzz the target.
1.  Additional settings can be changed in the ```Options``` sub-tab.
    1. The ```Grep-Extract``` section is pretty useful. The words entered in this section is seached in the response by the ```Intruder```. This can be used to sort useful responses.
1. The user can start the intruder by clicking on the ```Intruder``` menu item and then selecting ```Start attack```.

:warning: The tab-name in the intruder section can be re-named by clicking on the tab. The default value is 1, 2, ... . 

## Comparer

The comparer is used to compare the response of the HTTP requests sent by the intruder. After analyzing the results from the intruder, if the user finds them interesting, the responses can be sent to the comparer for comparision.
