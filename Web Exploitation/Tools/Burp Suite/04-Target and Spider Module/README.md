# Target and Spider Module

## Target module

The target presents all the sites that we have visited in an organised manner. It groups all relavent information together which makes examining all the files or a given url a lot easier. 

We can also define the scope for the target. This prevents burp from examining other sites. The scope is usually set during pen-testing to avoid testing portions of the application to which we don't have access. 

## Spider module 

Spider module was present at the top-level in Burp 1.x but from Burp 2.x, the spider feature was moved to Dashboard module. The spider can be initiated by clicking on the ```New Task``` button at the top right. 

The spider module is a web-crawler that lists out all the links in a webpage. The links can then be examined to perform tasks required by the user. 

```Burp``` also provides the user with the option to fill out forms for them. We can set default values for filling out all form or we can also make Burp propmt the user whenever it encounters a form. The same is also possible for login pages.
