# Proxy Module

The proxy module is one of the most used modules of ```Burp```. 

The proxy modules have the following tabs -

1.  **Intercept**

    This tab allows the user to turn the intercept on or off. It also gives the user with the option to either forward or drop the intercept. 

    The intercept tab only displays the result of the request and not the repsonse by default. In order to view the response, the following has to be done - 

    1.  Go to the ```options``` tab of the ```Proxy``` module.
    1.  Enable the checkbox with **Was intercepted** relationship. 

    :warning: You can modify the HTTP params directly in the intercept tab.

1.  **HTTP History**

    This tab contains the history of all the ```HTTP``` requests and responses. The request and response can be viewed by going to the corresponding sub-tab. 

1.  **Websockets History**

    More on this later.

1.  **Options**

    This shows all the settings that be done in the proxy module.
